    <h1>Higher-order functions - Part 1 of Functional Programming in Javascript</h1>

    <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Higher-Order Functions - functions are values just like strings or numbers function can be assigned to variables or pass into other functions </li>
            <ul>
                <li>What are they good for? <strong>Composition</strong></li>
                <li>the fact that we can take one function and put it into another function allows us to compose a lot of small functions into bigger functions</li>
                <li>filter - is a function on the array that accepts another function as its argument which it will use to return a new filter version of the array</li>
                <li>e.g. var dogs = animals.filter(function(animal) { <br> return animal.species === 'dog'</li>
                <li>functions that you send into another functions are called <strong>Callback function</strong> because the host function will call back to them</li>
                <li>filter will loop through each item in the array and for each item it's going to pass it into the callback function and when it does it will expect the callback function to return either true or false toe tell filter whether or not this
                    item should be in the new array </li>


            </ul>
            <li>You'll write code faster when you're doing functional programming</li>
            <li>means that you can write software with less bugs and less time</li>
            <li>filter uses a lot less code then the for loop</li>
            <li>less code , less logic</li>
            <li>when we write our software in small simple functions they compose together which allows us to reuse functions all over the place</li>
            <li>the filter function is just one line of logic</li>
            <li>the callback function and the filter function merged into eachother</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
